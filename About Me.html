<center><P> I was borned in the Bronx but raised in  <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y6XUoE0ztgE/maxresdefault.jpg"> Spanish Harlem </a> with  <a href="http://www.nyctourist.com/sites/default/files/central_park_billboard_0.jpg"> Central Park </a> as my back yard, it was here where I learned I had a passion for landscape photography. When I was about 10 years old I recieved a  <a href="http://cdn-4.nikon-cdn.com/e/Q5NM96RZZo-aRYhaO9IvtTEH3BkNKBXjyzSU-Dmc2NKGyIQMfcEG4A==/Views/1689_FM10_front.png"> film camera </a> which I took everywhere with me until one day I lost it in the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Pelham_Bay_Park-bound_R142A_6_train_arriving_at_Buhre_Av.jpg">train </a>. Years late I took photography class in high school where we learned how to devolp film and in college I took a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2000x2000/Nikon_25492_D3200_DSLR_Camera_With_856049.jpg"> digital photography </a>class. Beacuase of all experience I know consider myself a professional photographer. I love to volunteer for STEM programs that encourage minorities and women. My favorite event is <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/666984963527581699/HB7LrZCl.jpg"> First Lego League </a> which I am always a core value judge and recently the assistant to the head couch. </center>
