<center><P> I was borned in the Bronx but raised in  <a href="First Lego League"> Spanish Harlem </a> with  <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org"> Central Park </a> as my back yard. Since and early age <br> I knew I did not want to be like those people outside my window who just terrorized the neighborhood. <br> When I was about 10 years old I recieved a  <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/browse/Film-Cameras/ci/9812/N/4288586278"> film camera </a> which I took everywhere with me until one day I lost it in the <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf">train </a>. Years late I took photography classes and now I like to pretend I'm a professional photographer. <br> I love to volunteer for STEM programs that encourage minorities and women. My favorite event is <a href="http://firstlegoleague.org"> First Lego League <a/> which I am always a core value judge and recently the assistant to the head couch. </center>
